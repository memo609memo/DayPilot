# DayPilot



## Introduction:

DayPilot is an all in one application aimed at maximizing personal productivity combining scheduling, reminders, sticky notes, and analytics all in one unified yet minimalistic interface. While other applications require the user to bounce between the different tools app to app, DayPilot has everything you’ll need to generate more workflow all in one place. Whether you are struggling to create structure in your day and end up doing nothing, or just have too many tasks to manage, DayPilot will help you. 

The goal of this project is to solve the chaos caused by productivity tools being unmanageable and slower due to separation. DayPilot offers users a hassle free experience by combining multiple managing tools into one place for their discretion. Scheduling, note-taking, reminders, & analytics all combined into one user-friendly interface. The goal is to simplify everyday organization and reduce the inconvenience of bouncing between multiple applications.
